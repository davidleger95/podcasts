    As consumers, online reviews are one of the few weapons we have fight back against the tyranny of our corporate overlords and hold them accountable in the free market… at least if your name is Karen. Seriously though, online reviews hold some of the Internet’s most precious hidden gems. They’ve given people with nothing better to do a forum to vent their frustrations and commemorate wholesome moments about their most beloved and hated products, services, and establishments. This is late-stage capitalism at it’s finest.

    > As consumers, online reviews are our way to fight back against the tyranny of our corporate overlords and hold them accountable in the free market.

    _Review Revue_ puts front and centre the best the Internet has to offer of online reviews. Each week, Reilly Anspaugh and Geoffrey James bring us hilarious reviews based on a given topic and infuse them with improv comedy bits. Personally I’ve never been much of a fan of improv comedy, most people aren’t very good at it, but Reilly and Geoffrey are a rare exception. It really helps bring these reviews to life and makes the show so much more than just a curation of funny reviews.  They cover summer camps, beginner magic kits, trampoline parks, and so many more awesome topics!

    An added bonus to this show is the 110% effort Reilly and Geoffrey put into their ad reads. Never have I been more entertained by an ad for windshield wipers and automotive oil filters.

    In an attempt to escape the island of Crete, Icarus and his father each donned a pair of wax wings and took flight. Icarus’s father warned him to not fly too low or be consumed by the sea, nor too high or the wax wings would melt in the sun’s heat. Despite this warning, Icarus still climbed higher into the sky, his wax wings melted away, and he plunged into the sordid seas where he drowned.

    Because of Icarus, we know not to fly too close to the sun, to be wary of our hubris, to know it can betray us and many make us act in defiance of caution. One thing that separates humans from other animals is our ability to share stories like this. The sharing of our collective experience through cautionary tales has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species. We can learn the lessons of Icarus without suffering the same deadly fate firsthand. But we don’t have to rely solely on ancient myths for such lessons; there are also many real-life cautionary tales from which to draw lessons.

    > It is the sharing of our collective experience through stories that has allowed us to survive and thrive as a species.

    Written and narrated by Tim Harford, _Cautionary Tales_ brings us true stories of blunders, mishaps, and disasters throughout history, and shares the valuable lessons we can learn from them. This podcast is both informative and entertaining, weaving Tim’s narration with audio reenactments of the events, emerseing us in these thrilling tales. 

    A blimp race that turned deadly, a mixup at the Oscars which awarded _Best Picture_ to the wrong film, and a whole mini-season about pandemics; these real-life parables are just a few of the cautionary tales presented in this podcast. Each carrying with it, a valuable lesson we can apply to situations in our own lives.

    The current geological time period is known as the Anthropocene. Beginning in 10,000 BCE, it’s the period in which humans have shaped the Earth to our desires in ways which are honestly god-like. For better or worse, we’ve left more than our fair share of marks on this planet. 

    Hosted by John Green — best-selling author of _The Fault in Our Stars_ and _Paper Towns_, among many others — _The Anthropocene Reviewed_ explores different facets of our human-centred planet and rates them on a five-star scale.  This podcast really showcases John’s talent as a writer, but this time in a non-fiction context as he reviews the human experience as if it were a commodity to be consumed.

    > John crafts melancholic narratives that make the scarred moments of his life beautiful, and the beautiful moments even more beautiful.

    Conforming such complex topics as _our capacity for wonder_ into such a simplistic rating system is both naive and satisfying. All the nuance and messiness, the beauty and the ugliness, reduced to a mere number. However, John pours his passion into his reviews, presenting them as deeply personal memoirs. He crafts melancholic narratives that make the scarred moments of his life beautiful, and the beautiful moments even more beautiful. By the time he gets to the end of the review, his final rating seems almost inconsequential. And that’s kind of the point.

    John, I give _The Anthropocene Reviewed_ five stars.

    Have you ever been so over-exposed to something that you’ve largely forgotten what it was like to experience it for the first time? After awhile, even the most entertaining stories can get stale. Sometimes it makes you wish you could obliviate yourself just so you can re-discover that initial joy yet again.

    > Most nineties kids grew up being force-fed Harry Potter. Still a rare few somehow managed to evade it.

    Most nineties kids grew up being force-fed Harry Potter. Still a rare few somehow managed to evade it. Mike Schubert is one of those rare few. When Mike began _Potterless_ he was a man in his mid-twenties who had never experienced the Harry Potter series. But since then, he has powered through all of the books, movies, and some fan-made content such as A Very Potter Musical and Potter Puppet Pals. He has even suffered through the cringefest known as _Harry Potter and the Cursed Child_.  One hundred and fifty one episodes in (and still counting), Mike now considers himself a full-blown Potterhead.

    Throughout his journey into the wizarding world, Mike helps us relive our childhood memories of experiencing Harry Potter for the first time, but through the eyes of an adult. Each episode he is joined by a guest who is well-versed in Harry Potter to offer a contrasting viewpoint. His recaps, hilarious hot takes, and excited speculation about what’s to come will give you a whole new perspective on the series. This is one I think both casual and hardcore fans of Harry Potter will enjoy.

    The Internet has quickly become the centrepiece of our rapidly changing society. We’ve left the dark ages of dial-up and have been thrust into this brave new world filled with dank memes, digital crime, Elon Musk shitposting on Twitter, and so much more. The Internet is both exciting and terrifying, it brings us together in some ways but divides us in many others. It’s a confounding paradox we live with every day, making it nearly impossibly to get our bearings and understand what’s going on around us.

    > The Internet is exciting and terrifying, it brings us together in some ways but divides us in others.

    _Reply All_ explores weird and interesting Internet phenomena. Each episode, PJ Vogt and Alex Goldman (and recently Emmanuel Dzotsi) dive deep down rabbit holes which are seemingly bottomless. They explore questions like: _How do tech support scams work?_, _Who started the  Incel community?_ and _What’s the deal with drop-shipping?_

    Demonstrating some amazing feats of investigative journalism, _Reply All_ takes your tough questions about the Internet and delivers answers that are often go far beyond what you ever would have expected. Even as a software engineer, I’m often surprised by what I learn from this show. _Reply All_ will help you up your Internet savviness and understand the digital world in which we live.

    One of the most tragic qualities of great design is that we often neglect its subtle ingenuity. We forget that everything manmade had to first be conceived in someone’s mind before springing into existence. Even concepts that seem boringly obvious — the shopping mall, the drinking straw, the street address — didn’t exist at one point. Our world is full of these invisible artifacts of design.

    > One of the most tragic qualities of great design is that we often neglect its subtle ingenuity.

    This podcast is hard to describe succinctly because it has such a broad reach in scope. Essentially, _99% Invisible_ explores the intriguing stories of our modern world that are often hiding in plain sight. The show is hosted by Roman Mars, and occasionally by other member of the _99% Invisible_ staff. They’ve covered a lot of topics in the ten years since the show’s inception. With such a long track record that the influences of design and architecture are ubiquitous and enigmatic.

    Design and architecture have always been secondary passions of mine. I see deep parallels between them and my own field of software development. The balancing of technical skill and artistry, utility and aesthetics, are at the forefront of both disciplines. Over the years, _99% Invisible_ has fed my affinity for this passion. It’s one of the first podcasts I started listening to, and it remains one of my favourites even today.
